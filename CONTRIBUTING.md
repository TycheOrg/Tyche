### Coding Guidelines

Pretty much just follow the [Microsoft Guidelines for C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff926074.aspx). If a given file has deviations then just follow the style in that file.

### General
- Work should be `PR'ed` to the `Development` branch -unless it is for a feature that has a specific branch.

### Issues
[These issues are ready to go](https://github.com/TycheOrg/Tyche/labels/ready)
#### Pull Requests
- A `PR` that contains a major change should be connected to an issue. For small changes go straight to the `PR`
  - It is okay to open the `issue` and `pull request` at the same time.
- `[WIP]` pull request are more then okay.

### Areas of Focus
The main area that this project needs help with is data. More morphemes, more categories, and more options in a category.
