###Properties
####Previous Names
```c#
IList<string> PreviousNames { get; set; }
```
Holds all the names previously generated by the Tyche. Can be lazy-loaded.
####Categories
```c#
Dictionary<string, IList<string>> Categories { get; set; }
```
Holds all the values organized by category. The key is the category name, which may or may not be mapped to a physical object like a file name or table name.
####Morphemes
```c#
IList<string> Morphemes { get; set; }
```
Holds the morphems for Tyche to use.
###Methods
####ResetPreviousNames
```c#
void ResetPreviousNames();
```
Clears the previously generated names. There is no garentee that the clear is persisted to the underlying data source.
####SavePreviousNames
```c#
void SavePreviousNames();
```
Persists the previously generated names to the underlying source.
##Default Source
Tyche comes with a default source that uses `json` files as a persistence source.
The default source will create the files if they don't exist - but they will be empty.

It serves as a simple example for writing your own implementation.
